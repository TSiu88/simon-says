## Description

This is a webpage written for the Epicodus Intro to Programming and C#/React course.  It is the game of Simon Says where the program would pick a random color and then the user has to repeat that color.  With each round the computer does the same sequence and adds one more color to the end.  It keeps track of the sequence and the user has to repeat it or they lose.
